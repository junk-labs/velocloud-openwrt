7.2	Intel may terminate this Agreement and any licenses granted in the Agreement at any time if Licensee fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after notice of the breach.  Such termination will not prejudice Intel's right to damages or any other remedy available at law or in equity.

7.3	Upon termination of the Agreement or any license granted hereunder for any reason whatsoever, Licensee will completely remove FSP from all programs. In the event of any termination, Licensee will, at Intel's option, either return to Intel or destroy the original and all full or partial copies of FSP and certify to Intel that they have been destroyed.

9.0	EXPORT CONTROL

Neither party will export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the FSP without first obtaining any required license or other approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other agency or department of the United States Government.  In the event any product or software is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by either party, that party will ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product or software is in compliance with all laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government.  Both parties agree that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries will export/re-export any software, technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining the license or approval.

10.0	GENERAL

10.1	Any dispute arising directly under the express terms of this Agreement or the grounds for termination of any rights granted under this Agreement will be resolved as follows: First, within forty five (45) days from one party's written request to the other, senior executives of both parties will meet to attempt to resolve the dispute. If the senior executives cannot resolve the dispute, either party may then make a written demand for formal dispute resolution by tendering to the other party notice of the dispute and its intent to invoke the terms of this Section 10.1. The parties agree to meet within ninety (90) days of the demand with an impartial mediator selected by mutual agreement to participate in a one-day, non-binding mediation. In the event the parties cannot agree on a mediator, they will each select one nominator, who will not at that time be employed by either party, and the two nominators will agree on and appoint the mediator. If the parties have not resolved the dispute or claim within thirty (30) days after the one-day, non-binding mediation, either party may begin litigation proceedings.

10.2	This is the complete and exclusive Agreement between the parties relating to this subject matter. No amendment will be effective unless in writing signed by authorized representatives of both parties.

10.3	The terms and conditions stated in the Agreement are declared to be severable. If any paragraph, provision, or clause in this Agreement will be found or be held to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction in which this Agreement is being performed, the remainder of this Agreement will be valid and enforceable and the parties will use good faith to negotiate a substitute, valid and enforceable provision which most nearly effects the parties' intent in entering into this Agreement.

10.4	Any claim arising under or relating to this Agreement, will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its conflicts of laws provisions.  The parties agree that all disputes and litigation regarding the above defined claims will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or of the Federal courts sitting in Delaware.
