iperf3 is a tool for measuring achievable bandwidth on IP networks.



For Velocloud Edge

1. The Makefile in this directory was created to enable
   compile of iperf3 for openwrt. In its current form,
   the Makefile creates a package in the .ipk format

2. On an OpenWRT target, if installed, iperf3 is the
   binary installed.

IMPORTANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The test tool needs iperf3 (instead of iperf or iperf2) since this
allows us to run the server unattended, and control all test behavior
(as in iperf2) from the client, as well as extract test results in
JSON format. This is done to ensure that scripts that work on
processing the results see a common format.
