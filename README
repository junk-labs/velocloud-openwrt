    This is a readme just for velocloud source code repo users (ie doesnt apply
    to Aleksander)

    This repository is maintained as a git submodule from the velocloud-modems
    space. For more info on submodule read through http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules

    If you are reading this file because you ran into some build errors etc.., all you
    might have to do are the below two commands from your velocloud.src workspace

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

    Do the above two commands and that should populate this repository and then you can
    commit your stuff. Unless you are going to make any changes to contents in this directory,
    thats all you probably ever have to do. If you plan to make changes to modem files,
    then you better read through the git-scm link and understand things before committing anything

    Just touching the readme
