1. Create a new folder anywhere on your system. This will hold your workspace metadata. There can be no spaces in folder name or in the file path.
	For example, place your workspace in c:\myWorkspace, and not in 'c:\Users\JoeUser\Documents and Settings\My Documents\myWorkspace'.
2. Start the Sage EDK.
3. If you are prompted for a workspace at startup, select the new folder you have created.
   Otherwise, when the EDK starts, select File -> Switch Workspace and then select the new folder you have created.
4. Select File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects Into the Workspace. Make sure to check "Search for nested projects".
5. When prompted to "Select a directory to search for existing Eclipse projects", select the "coreboot" folder in the folder containing this readme.

6. Instructions for IPXE:
	IPxe is a network boot solution that is built into some SageBIOS BSP solutions. If your BSP includes IPxe (found in coreboot/payloads/ipxe),
	you can either configure Ipxe for your Sage EDK build or turn off Ipxe in your coreboot configuration.
		A. Turning off IPxe:
			1) Select the coreboot project.
			2) Load the Sage EDK KConfig Tool. It shoud be pre-populated with coreboot's
			   Kconfig file (located at $path_to/coreboot/src/Kconfig). If not, use the
			   browse button to select that file.
			3) Hit the "Load" Button in the Kconfig tool.
			4) select the PXE ROM menu, uncheck "Add a PXE ROM image."
			5) Select "Back"
			6) Select "Save"
			7) iPxe will not be built into your SageBIOS rom.
		B. Configuring iPxe for building:
			1) Right click in the Project Explorer view.
			2) Select New -> Project... -> C/C++ -> Makefile Project with Existing Code
			3) Name the project iPxe
			4) Under "code location", browse to coreboot/payloads/ipxe
			5) Select the "Coreboot XGCC Toolchain" for your toolchain.
			6) Hit "Finish". You will see the iPxe project appear.
			7) Load the Sage EDK KConfig Tool
			8) Select the coreboot project, then hit the "Load" Button in the Kconfig tool.
			9) Select the PXE Rom Menu
			10) Under PXE ROM filename, you'll see something like "payloads/ipxe/src/bin/10ec8168.rom"
			    The last number is the PCI ID of the NIC that iPxe will use to communicate. Each board can
			    be different, depending on customization you may have done. SageBIOS will include the
			    standard NIC for any given board.
			11) Right click the iPxe project.
			12) Go to Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Behavior
			13) Under Build (Incremental Build), add "bin/<PCI ID>.rom" (ie, bin/10ec8168.rom from above).
			14) Select OK
			15) iPxe is now customized and set to build for your SageBIOS application. It will build automatically
			    when you run your top level coreboot build.

7. Once that's complete, highlight the coreboot project in the project explorer and hit the build button (the
   hammer in the top tool bar).
