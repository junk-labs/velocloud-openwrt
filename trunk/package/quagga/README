Instructions for Local Edit/Compile/Debug
=========================================

For best results, here are two possible workflows you can adopt for
working on quagga sources.

1. The OpenWrt Way
==================

This is generally simple, but can be tedious, and you have to do it on a
machine that has enough horsepower to build the full OpenWrt tree. (Typically
we tend to work on the build1-losaltos server - 172.16.3.150).

a. Check out the openwrt tree and build it once, for one target:

    make edge500

This can take a few hours, if you do it on a slow machine.

Now you cd to "trunk", which will be the base of your activities.

b. To Edit/compile, you make the changes to the sources in the following
   build directory:

      build_dir/target-x86_64_eglibc-2.15/quagga-<version>

c. Edit the files as you like, and then, from the "trunk" directory,
   issue the command

      make package/quagga/compile

d. This will generate binaries under the build_dir location above, in
   the pkg-install directory, and also generate openwrt packages (.ipks)
   in bin/x64-eglibc/packages.

e. When you are ready to check in the changes, you need to copy the changed
   files, and new files, to the corresponding location under 
   trunk/package/quagga/src (and delete source files that you deleted).

   To be sure that your changes are ready to check in, delete the build
   directory (build_dir/.../quagga-<version>), and re-issue the "make"
   command above from the "trunk" directory. If this builds cleanly, then
   your changes should be ready to check in (from trunk/package/quagga).

HINT: The best way to ensure that you pick up the right set of changes is
to make a full copy of the build directory above after step 1, using "cp -a".
When you're ready to start checking in changes, you can do a recursive diff
between the two directories and see what files you have touched easily.


2. Edit/Compile/Debug on other machines (without full OpenWrt builds):

I have checked in an alternate setup, where you can run a local script
(SetupBuild) to set up a build directory locally (under package/quagga,
as a sibling of "src"), and run configure.

After this, you will be able to make changes under the "build" directory,
and just run "make" from the build directory.  If you want to pick up the
executables and libraries that you'll need to move elsewhere to test, you
can run (from the build directory):

   make install DESTDIR=`(cd ../install && pwd)`

and this will create install/{usr,etc}/...

HINT: Again, you SHOULD make a copy of the "build" directory immediately
after you run "SetupBuild", so that you can do a recursive diff between
the saved build directory and the current one.  You can run "make clean"
in the build directory if you want to limit the chatter about object files
in the diff output.
